# Creating-designs-by-openlane
This repository contains various circuit designs created using the open-source OpenLane tool, which automates the process of converting Register-Transfer Level (RTL) descriptions of digital circuits into GDSII layout files. These designs have been developed using the SKY130 Process Design Kit (PDK), a technology library provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry specifically designed for the 130nm process node.

To execute these circuit designs within a Google Colab environment, you will first need to download the 'requirements-dev.txt' file and upload it into your Colab workspace. Afterward, you should restart the runtime and proceed to run each cell in the notebook sequentially.

The repository hosts a collection of different circuit designs, showcasing the capabilities of OpenLane and the SKY130 PDK in creating integrated circuits for various applications.
